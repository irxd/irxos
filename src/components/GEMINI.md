# Components Rules

- Shared UI components from `@/components/ui/` follow shadcn patterns
- Dialog components from `@/components/dialogs/` handle common dialog patterns
- Custom hooks from `@/hooks/` provide reusable functionality
- Apps leverage shared components but define app-specific UI in their own components folder

### Custom Components
These are custom implementations (not shadcn):
- `audio-input-button`
- `audio-bars`
- `volume-bar`
